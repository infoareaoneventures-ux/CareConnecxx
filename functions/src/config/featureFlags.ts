// browser actions (appointment booking, pharmacy refill, insurance check) DARK
// until the pre-launch gate closes:
//   1. HIPAA/BAA compliance sign-off (GCP BAA in place + consent scope reviewed).
//   2. OQ6 — approver-identity decision: is phone-as-sole-identity acceptable for
//      committing healthcare actions, or is a second factor / CANCEL window /
//      out-of-band execution notice required first?
//   3. Supported launch-portal list confirmed (MyChart + CVS/Walgreens/RiteAid
//      + the generic insurer URL).
//   4. Browserbase per-action cost guardrails (the two-pass premium).
// See docs/runbooks/healthcare-action.md for the full checklist + recovery.
